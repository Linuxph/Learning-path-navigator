DevPath: Personalized Learning Path Navigator 

A full-stack MERN application that allows users to create, visualize, and track their progress on custom learning roadmaps, featuring an interactive node-based editor and AI-powered quiz generation.

Key Features

    Secure User Authentication: Full login/signup functionality using JWT for secure, stateless authentication and protected backend routes.

    Interactive Roadmap Editor: A dynamic, graph-based UI built with React Flow that allows users to:

        Create, edit, and delete content nodes.

        Form connections between nodes with multiple handles.

        Pan, zoom, and fit the entire roadmap to the view.

    Smart Content Nodes: Paste a URL and the backend automatically scrapes metadata using Cheerio, detecting the content type (article, image, video) and fetching relevant thumbnails and summaries to create rich content previews.

    AI-Powered Quizzes: With a single click, generate a custom multiple-choice quiz for any learning path. The backend constructs a detailed prompt from the path's content and uses the Google Gemini API to create relevant questions.

    Progress Tracking: Mark individual nodes as complete and see your overall path progress updated in real-time on the dashboard, with calculations automated by Mongoose middleware on the backend.

    Modern Frontend: Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, featuring a themed, animated authentication page and a central AuthContext for global state management.

Setup the Backend:

    Navigate to the backend folder: cd backend

    Install NPM packages: npm install

    Create a .env file in the backend root and add your variables:
    Code snippet

    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    JWT_LIFETIME=30d
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_studio_api_key

    Start the server: npm start
    The backend will be running on http://localhost:3000.

Setup the Frontend:

    From the root directory, navigate to the frontend folder: cd ../frontend

    Install NPM packages: npm install

    Create a .env file in the frontend root for the API URL:
    Code snippet

        REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
